## Summary of Findings

### Click Behavior:
- There is a statistically significant difference in the average number of live button clicks per user between the control and treatment groups. Users in the control group clicked the live button more frequently on average.

### Retention Rates:
- The live button retention rate is significantly higher in the control group compared to the treatment group. This indicates that, percentage-wise, more users continued using the live button in the control group after initially discovering it.
- However, in absolute numbers, more users in the treatment group discovered and initially used the live button, showing a higher feature discovery rate.

### Guardrail Metrics:
- There is no statistically significant difference in the average or total number of odds and ads impressions per user between the groups, suggesting that the changes in the experiment did not adversely affect these metrics.

### Additional Observations:
- Despite higher discovery rates in the treatment group, the proportion of users who continued to use the live button after discovery was significantly lower compared to the control group.
- No statistically significant difference was found in the clicks on related paired events (follow/unfollow league and player) between the groups.

## Conclusions
- The control group demonstrated both a higher engagement with the live button and better retention over time, indicating that users were more committed to using the live button in its old format.
- The treatment group, while having more users discover the live button (possibly due to the new layout or visibility improvements), did not see the same level of continued use, suggesting that the new design may not have been as effective in retaining user engagement.
- The lack of significant differences in ads and odds impressions implies that the experiment did not impact these guardrail metrics, which is positive in terms of not negatively affecting user exposure to advertisements or odds.
