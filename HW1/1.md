Based on column odds_impression, which  has properties:
       event_id and status
and whose description is:
       "User made odds impression (saw odds on screen an stayed there for at least a second)."

and since there are span elements "Show odds" and "DROPPING ODDS" on screen, I am unsure if column odds_impression covers both of the cases, and in case if yes, I'd extend the monitoring of those two buttons separately.

I believe it could be a valuable metric to determine whether the user is believed to have interest in sports betting (at least recreational), based on "Show odds" button, but clicking on "DROPPING ODDS" would indicate that the user is tracking the odds for the games and is more interested in placing the bet.  

One argument I believe this is untracked in odds_impression event, is that I believe it looks the same at users with different intentions. Clicking on "DROPPING ODDS", as well as on "LIVE" and "SHOW ODDS", would be more indicative of the user behaviour, which would be that he is interested in placing a bet on a game.

Suggestion would be a split to two columns.
